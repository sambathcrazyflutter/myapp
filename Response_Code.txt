304 (Not Modified)   resource has not been modified   client still has a same  previously-downloaded copy.


400 (Bad Request) The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without modifications.

401 (Unauthorized)  It may have provided the wrong credentials or none at all. 

403 (Forbidden)   the client’s request is formed correctly, but the REST API refuses to honor . Authentication will not help, and the request SHOULD NOT be repeated.

405 (Method Not Allowed)  A 405 response must include the Allow header, which lists the HTTP methods that the resource supports
